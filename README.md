# DeFAI---Decentralized-Finance-AI-based-Fraud-Detection-

##  Overview  
DeFAI is an **AI-driven security layer** for the DeFi ecosystem.  
It leverages **Machine Learning (ML)** models to continuously analyze on-chain data and transaction patterns, detecting anomalies that indicate **fraudulent activities** such as flash loan exploits, rug pulls, and other hacks.  

The system acts as a **proactive, intelligent watchdog**, providing real-time alerts and enabling automated responses through smart contract integration.  

---

##  Problem Statement  
The explosive growth of DeFi has been accompanied by **billions in losses due to hacks**.  
- Static code audits and post-mortem analyses are insufficient.  
- Users and protocols suffer huge trust deficits after each exploit.  


---

##  Why Blockchain + AI?  
- **Blockchain**: Provides immutable, transparent, and public on-chain data, perfect for training detection models.  
- **AI/ML**: Offers predictive power to spot novel attack vectors that static tools miss.  

This synergy builds a **next-gen security layer** for DeFi protocols.  

---

##  Value Proposition  
- **For DeFi Protocols & Institutions**: Real-time risk mitigation and loss prevention.  
- **For Developers & Businesses**: Continuous, dynamic security beyond static audits.  
- **For Ecosystem**: Increased trust, stability, and adoption of DeFi.  

---

##  Tech Stack  
- **Blockchain Platform**: Ethereum / EVM-compatible chains (Polygon, Arbitrum).  
- **Smart Contract Language**: Solidity.  
- **Token Standards**: ERC-20 (for staking / utility token, if needed).  
- **ML/AI**: Python, Jupyter, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow.  
- **Data Storage**: IPFS / Arweave (for ML training datasets).  
- **Oracles/Bridges**: Chainlink (for secure data feeds).  
- **Frontend**: React (dashboard for alerts & anomaly visualization).  
- **Backend**: REST API serving ML predictions.

## 🧪 Project Roadmap (Hackathon Week)  
- **Day 1**: Setup environment, acquire on-chain data, preprocessing.  
- **Day 2**: Train baseline ML model (Isolation Forest / NN).  
- **Day 3**: Feature engineering (flash loan & swap patterns).  
- **Day 4**: Backend + API for anomaly scoring.  
- **Day 5**: Build React-based Alert Dashboard.  
- **Day 6**: End-to-end testing (data → model → API → dashboard).  
- **Day 7**: Documentation, final polishing, and demo prep.  

---

## 🔐 Security Approach  
- Unit + integration tests for all contracts.  
- Internal security reviews.  
- Plan for formal third-party audits before mainnet deployment.  

---

## 📊 Differentiation  
- **Existing tools**: Post-mortem analysis, static audits.  
- **DeFAI**: Proactive anomaly detection, real-time scoring, adaptive ML models.  
- **Unique Feature**: *Anomaly Score* → severity + novelty rating for suspicious events.
